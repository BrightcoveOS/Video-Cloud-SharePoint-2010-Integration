About
============
The SharePoint 2010 integrations allows publishers to search for videos, edit video properties, upload videos, publish players to their web pages and create playlistsâ€”all from within SharePoint. For more information, visit the [SharePoint partner profile](http://www.brightcove.com/en/partners/sharepoint-2010).


Requirements
============
This SharePoint integration requires the media API, so you should be prepared to enter your read and write tokens into your SharePoint configuration settings. If you only share your read token you will be limited to viewing your library and publishing players to pages, as the ability to edit, create playlists and upload new videos all require the write token.
